		You are now ready to begin honing your skills in combat. 
		Hunt the <font color="LEVEL">keltirs</font> that run loose in the fields northwest of Cedric's Training Hall. 
		You will please <font color="LEVEL">retrieve four keltir fangs, a quest item obtained from dead keltirs.</font> 
		When you finish this assignment, I have a reward for you.
